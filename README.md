# tdd-jest-boilerplate

This is a template for getting up and running with TDD Katas.

If you want to commit your progress, set up a project on github and then simply clone down, and run `git remote set-url origin [url of your git project]` to change the remote url.

You can then run

```
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
